The party gathers in the lobby to await the beginning of their next adventure. While waiting, Ace plays an encouraging song known as The Duck Song to give heroic inspiration to Ash and Dante. Eventually, a glowing staircase appears. The party climbs them.

They end up facing a giant stone wizard tower. It seems to stretch on forever, and the top is not visible from the ground. The tower sits on a stone slab with sediment under it. It is also inside the eye of a bad storm, characterized by frequent lightning and dense, dark clouds. However, no one can feel any thunder, nor hear any wind. Every so often, floating balls of light swirl around the tower. Despite the stormy atmosphere, everything is lit up as if my sunlight.  The staircase that the party used to approach the tower extends about 10 feet back before ending in nothingness. 

The tower has large (15-20ft) doors made of granite. They have large knockers at shoulder height for medium sized creatures. There is a mat in front of the door that blends in with the stone. Ash lifts the mat and gets a face full of dust, causing them to be blinded. Dante sees a key under the mat and picks it up. To help Ash navigate while they are blind, Ace holds his hand. Ash then decides to wash their eyes with water from their waterskin, which allows them to see again, but he has ash all over his face. 

Ace goes up to the door and knocks three times with the knocker. The party hears a clicking sound for about 60 seconds. Everyone gets as far away from the door as they can because they fear the door will explode. After that time, the door slowly swings open. 

Ash and Dante notice an illumination coming from the doorway, but to Ace, it looks dark inside. Ash and Dante can see that the room is a large square, and there are sigils on the ground in each of the cardinal directions inside the room. The northern sigil seems to have a blue glow coming from it. As the party enters the room, they notice 3 skeletons wearing tattered robes (like magic academy student robes). One skeleton is on the northern sigil, one is underneath the southwestern staircase, and one is on the eastern wall. To the northeast, there is a staircase heading down, and to the southwest there is a staircase heading up. The skeletons reveal that they are animate, and the skeleton on the northern sigil attack Dante with a blue lightning ball, beginning combat.

Despite the teleportation, fire, and some invisibility attempts, the party eventually defeats the skeleton. They decide to do a short rest in the room, during which they feel the tower shake a little bit. 

After resting, the party decides to go up the southwestern staircase. While ascending, they are encased in magical darkness, but they eventually emerge in the northeast corner of the floor above. No one sees any signs of life/animation, but there are signs of something living on the floor, as there are plates and cups scattered about, as well as a desk with scrolls in/around it. The scrolls have illegible scribbles and squiggles. 

The party ascends the stairs to the next floor, and there are more bookshelves and scrolls. There are enough scrolls that the party has difficulty moving around without stepping on them. Dante pulls books off the shelves and throws them on the ground, causing them to crumble to dust. One of the books was wet and it dissolves into book grey matter.

The party ascends again to the next floor, and there they see a large metal structure underneath the staircase. It seems to be a vault, with a large door handle on the metal structure. There are 4 desks with books on them in the room. Ace approaches the vault to inspect it. There are no messages, writing, or inscriptions on it, but there are two book-sized indentations. Additionally, on either side of the vault, there is a pile of dragon bones. They seem to be placed there intentionally. The eastern dragon has an inscription that says "Is this a curse?" and the western dragon has an inscription that says "Is this a blessing?"

Ace then goes to look at the books on the desk and finds that there are 7 books of note. 

1. "The Life and Death of a Wizard" 
2. "Wizarding 101" 
3. "How to Cast Magic for Dummies" 
4. "The Aftermath of Magical Accidents" 
5. "Why Muscles Help Wizards" 
6. "Undeath Isn't Too Bad, Right?"
7. "How to Reconnect With Your Estranged Loved Ones"

Ace picks up the Wizarding 101 book and holds the covers in each hand with the pages down, so any notes will fall out at their feet. They check all of the books this way, but no books have any notes in them. 

Ash puts "Aftermath of Magical Accidents" on the eastern slot, and "Undeath Isn't Too Bad, Right" on the western slot. As they do this, they see the eastern one starts to reassemble. The books are rejected and shot out to the opposite end of the room.

Ace tries to pull the bones that got reassembled apart, and feels abjuration magic on them.

Dante puts "Aftermath of Magical Accidents" on the western slot and "Life and Death of a Wizard" on the eastern one. The vault opens on its own to reveal 6,000 gold and a 3 pointed star. In the back of the vault, there are three buttons. Each one looks identical, but there are words inscribed on the wall above. From left to right, they read "Entrance", "Vault", "Study." Ash presses the "Entrance" button.

As Ash presses the button, a flash of light hits each party member and everyone ends up in front of the tower with the doors closed. Ash opens the door with the key Dante found earlier. This time, the sigils aren't present in the main room.

The party goes down the northeastern staircase, and end up on the same floor they started on. They decide to go up the stairs this time, ending up in a different room than the first time they went up. This room has a desk and a kitchenette. Ace notices that the kitchenette counter has nearly illegible scribblings carved into the counter. They can make out the words "Orville" and "why?" inscribed over and over again. 

Ace remarks out loud, "This is a sign of a person who has all of his mental faculties...like Frenwick!" Frenwick lets out a disembodied chuckle, and a mote of light appears at the bottom of the staircase going up. After climbing another 10 floors or so (about halfway up, Ash starts flying and starts holding Ace's hand), the party finally reaches a wooden room with candles burning. The fire is blue and magical of nature, likely as a result of the Eternal Flame spell. The room has windows that overlook the same "eye of the storm" scenery from earlier, but when the party looks out the window, they can't see the ground. The room is very well kept, with intricately designed bookcases, well treated books, and a desk that faces away from the staircase in the middle of the room.

At the desk, the top half of a human zombie floats. There are maggots falling off its body.  It appears to be writing. Ash calls out "Hello!" but Ace claps their hand over Ash's mouth to muffle it. Luckily, the zombie doesn't hear. 

Ash telepathically connects to Ace and Dante to pass messages and coordinate their next steps. The party decides that two of them should hide and one of them should go and talk to the zombie. Ace and Ash hide, while Dante sneaks up on the zombie to talk to it. While sneaking, Dante steps on a wooden board and it creaks. The zombie wizard whirls around and notices Dante and Ash, who failed their stealth check. Ace remains hidden.

The zombie wizard angrily asks why they're in his tower. Dante explains that the party was dropped into this area by Frenwick, a trickster god. The wizard compels Dante to approach, and puts a pouch containing 50 gold in Dante's hand. He then compels him to leave. Ash continues to try to talk to the wizard, eventually asking him to escort them out because they party can't descend past the 5th floor. The zombie wizard is persuaded to listen to Ash, and says he'll try to get him and Dante out of the tower and dismisses them. Ace, Ash, and Dante descend a floor, and as they do they feel the floor they were on start to shift down. 

Once the party gets down to the ground floor, the party calls out to Frenwick to ask what to do. Frenwick asks if they fought the lich, and the party responds that they hadn't, but they had talked to it. Frenwick is impressed they conviced the lich not to consume their souls, and decides that it counts as a battle of wits. He opens up a portal to the lobby, and the party goes through.

Frenwick is disappointed that the party didn't actually fight the lich, and tries to give everyone depression. Ace and Dante succeed on the save, but Ash fails and has the effect of the Bane spell. Frenwick says he'll lift the curse if Ace gives him the three pointed tear. Ace refuses, and Ash will remain baned for the duration of the next episode.
