### **Summary of Events**
The party members gather in the lobby of the mansion. Everyone notices that the time between sessions has been much more than usual. Even though the way time passes in the mansion is strange, the larger gaps feel suspicious. The party also hasn't heard from Frenwick in awhile. Normally, he can be heard making fun of other groups participating in his games, or he'll pull someone aside to ask for "advice" on what to make other groups face in their game. The party still feels Frenwick's power within the mansion, but comment on his silence.

Ash takes the opportunity since everyone has gathered to pass out antitoxins and healing potions to the group. Everyone receives 2 vials of each. 

After Ash finishes distributing the supplies, everyone feels the spooky sensation of the hairs on the back of their neck standing on end. The tips of the party's hair also starts to rise as they feel static electricity building in their heads before suddenly Frenwick clears his throat behind the party and the sensation dissipates.

Frenwick says, "I apologize for my absence, but I have been dealing with some things. You all need to go, NOW." He opens up a portal in front of the party. Eldrune hops on Damaia and walks through. The rest of the party follows. Just before they pass through, Ace turns to Frenwick and says, "Good luck with whatever this is." Frenwick responds under his breath, "Don't die this time." Ace responds, "I'll do my best" and then turns to walk through the portal.

The party ends up in a desert. It's night time and very cold. Upon observation, the party sees sand dunes all around them. Bridgette turns into a bat using her Cloak of the Bat to survey the area. Ash flies up in the air to attempt to do the same. 

Eldrune notices tiny paw prints in the sand, similar to those made by a small dog. However, they're weird. The center of the paw does look like that of a dog, but the toes are akin to human toes. The party decides to follow the tracks, which lead up a sand dune. At the top of the dune, Eldrune spots more tracks. These ones are more similar to humanoid tracks, but they're elongated. Eldrune recognizes the humanoid tracks as belonging to a Mind Flayer, while to dog-like tracks are Intellect Devourers.

The tracks themselves seem to disappear into the sand a short while after finding the humanoid ones. Nevertheless, the party continues on in the direction the tracks were pointing. Soon, Eldrune notices a slender figure with flowing appendages and a rather bulbous head. Next to it are two small, dog-sized creatures. She points this out to the rest of the party. The Mind Flayer and its pets were facing away from the party, but it begins to turn around. Eldrune uses her Nature's Mantle cloak to hide, but everyone else fails to get out of sight. The Mind Flayer finishes turning, and raises a finger in the air to send the Intellect Devourers running straight for the party. 

During the battle, two basilisks erupt from the sand. They seem to be angry that the battle between the party and the Mind Flayer is disturbing their territory. Bridgette manages to take out the two Intellect Devourers and the first basilisk, but the second basilisk turns the Mind Flayer into stone. The second basilisk is then killed, and the battle ends.

As the battle ends, the desert begins to brighten. Clouds roll away from the sky and a huge full moon becomes visible and lightens the area. Ace, having dropped their shield in the fight to cast magic, goes to retrieve it. Ash and Bridgette try to harvest scales and spikes from the corpses of the basilisks. They didn't extract the materials perfectly, and most of the spikes have cosmetic damages. However, Bridgette remains optimistic that she will still be able to use them to make some super sick armor.

The party takes a couple of minutes to patch themselves up and heal. After everyone is satisfied, the party notices that some sparkles appear to descend from the moon down onto the party. Everyone receives 35 temporary HP. However, as the sparkles descend, the moon seems to lose its brightness and turn from a bright white light to a dim red color, almost like a bloodmoon. The desert is now washed in a sickly red light. Despite the dim lighting, the party can see a figure floating down from the sky. The figure descending from the sky is identified as [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]]. Ace also notices 4 large snake-like creatures approaching the party from the cardinal directions.

As [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] floats down and gets within hearing range of the party, he says, "I hope that last boon from Frenwick was helpful to you, because you won't be getting any more." 

Ace tries to talk to him, asking, "What do you mean we won't be getting any more?" 

"You mean you can't feel Frenwick's power waning?" says [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]].

"He doesn't really communicate with us like that, he's not a constant presence in the back of our minds because we aren't his slaves,"  replies Ace.

"Unlike you!" interjects Ash.

[[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] says, "If only you knew..." with a menacing grin. 

"Well we don't, so would you care to enlighten us?" inquires Ace.

[[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] grimaces and says, "You think I'm the kind of villain to monologue?"

Ace responds with, "...yes?"

[[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] simply chuckles darkly and begins the battle by attacking Ash. Ace manages to mitigate the effects of the attack using Cutting Words, shouting "Get away from my friend!" [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] responds, "The friend that you've abandoned many times?" 

"What would you know of friendship, asshole?" retorts Ace.

The four lamia also enter the fray, managing to charm Bridgette. To Bridgette, the lamia that charmed her now looks like her ally [[Character Profile -- Will\|Will]]. Ash, driven primarily by rage and hate for [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]], launches a psychic lance at him, shouting, "Aro you absolute piece of shit, catch this!" Unfortunately, [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] somehow has acquired a lot of power, and uses a legendary resistance to mitigate the incapacitating effects of the spell, as well as half the damage.

[[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] then decides to attack Ace, and in a single turn Ace goes down. Ash ends up charmed by the lamia as well, who enact their geas feature. Luckily, the lamia forgot to issue a command to Ash initially. To Ash, the lamia that charmed him now also looks like an old ally, Fiorella. Ash, now "recognizing" a friend, telepathically communicates to the lamia that they plan to fireball [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] and to get out of the way. The lamia all jump back to avoid the blast.

Ash uses their 4-pointed [[Frenwick's Tears\|Frenwick's Tear]] to cast Fireball on [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]]. After this, [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] moves to go stand over Ace, who is still down. [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] puts his longsword at Ace's throat and commands the group to stand down. Ash hesitates, then grudgingly agrees. [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] forces Ash to drop his spellcasting focus to the ground. 

[[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] then turns to Bridgette and Eldrune. Bridgette initially refuses to drop her weapon, causing [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] to dig his sword into Ace's neck, drawing a little blood. Ash screams at [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]], "What did they ever do to you?" to which [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] responds, "Does it matter?"

Bridgette taunts [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]], saying he's afraid of a little healer. [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] is furious, and moves to attack her, doing quite a bit of damage and banishing her using Banishing Smite. During this time, Eldrune stabilizes Ace, but they can't be healed due to the effects of [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]]'s magic sword (a Longsword of Wounding).

Ash flies over to Ace and casts Death Armor on them to help in case [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] decides to stab Ace again. [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]], having dealt with Bridgette, throws his longsword up in the air and it vanishes in a puff of smoke. He approaches Ash and Ace. When he stands in front of them, he asks Ash, "Your life, or theirs?" while gesturing to Ace. Ash, without hesitating, says, "mine." [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] grins menacingly, grabs Ash by the throat, and they both disappear in a puff of smoke.

As they disappear, Bridgette reappears from banishment purgatory. Eldrune explains to her what happened while she was gone. Bridgette, after hearing that Ash sacrifices himself for Ace, asks, "Were they like, together?" Eldrune says she isn't really sure, but that they should probably wake up Ace.

Bridgette heals Ace with a healing potion. As they start to regain consciousness, Bridgette asks, "Are you and Ash a thing? An item?" Eldrune exclaims, "Bridgette! Not the time." Ace groggily responds, "...what?" 

Ace sits up and looks around. After a beat they ask, "Where's Ash?" After they learn from Eldrune that [[Character Profile -- Aro\|Aro]] kidnapped them and that Ash sacrificed himself, Ace begins to panic.  They stand up and yell toward the sky, "Frenwick, get your ass over here!" When nothing happens after a minute, they try again, saying, "Frenwick, I'm not interested in your fucking games at the moment! Get over here now, there's a situation!" Again, nothing happens, and Bridgette says, "I don't think he's gonna listen, he's not here anymore."

Ace really begins to become frantic. They notice that the moon still has a strange red light, and attempt to dispel the magic acting upon it. Nothing happens. Bridgette worries about how the party will get home, and turns into a bat to fly around and investigate. 

Ace decides to use their collection of low-level [[Frenwick's Tears\|Frenwick's Tears]] to attempt to contact Frenwick. They spend a couple of hours putting them in various formations, patterns, and sigils, until eventually they come across a conformation that causes the tears to emit a small chiming noise. 

Ace asks, "Is this Frenwick?" to which they hear another small chime. They then say, "If you can understand me, make two chimes." Two chiming noises are produced. Ace says, "Okay, I have some questions for you. Give me one chime for yes and two chimes for no. Do you understand?" The party hears a single chime.

A rough conversation between Ace and Frenwick ensues.

Ace: "Are you okay?"
Frenwick: two chimes

Ace: "Did Aro do this to you?"
Frenwick: two chimes

Ace: "Did someone working with Aro do this to you?"
Frenwick: one chime, then a pause, then three chimes

Ace: "I'm going to assume that the three chimes means 'kind of.' Do you know the name of the entity that did this to you?"
Frenwick: a long pause, then one chime

Ace: "Okay, I'm going to just go through the alphabet. Give me two chimes for a wrong letter and one chime for a right letter."

After a few minutes, Ace manages to get Frenwick to spell out the name "Vecna."

Ace: "Well that's not good."
Frenwick: Two chimes

Ace: "Do you know why Vecna is targeting you?"
Frenwick: One chime

Ace: "Can I guess?"
Frenwick: One chime

Ace: "Is it money?"
Frenwick: Two chimes

Ace: "Is it power?"
Frenwick: One chime

Ace: "Is there anything we can do to help you?"
Frenwick: One chime

Ace: "Is there anything we can do to help Ash?"
Frenwick: Two chimes

Ace: "If we save you, is there anything you can do to help Ash?"
Frenwick: One chime

Ace: "Are you on the same plane as us?"
Frenwick: Three chimes

Ace: "Are you in your mansion?"
Frenwick: Three chimes

Ace: "Can we get back to the mansion?"
Frenwick: One chime

Ace: "Is the mansion safe for us?"
Frenwick: Three chimes

Ace, in a sarcastic tone: "Wonderful, looks like we'll be sleeping in shifts."
Frenwick: One chime

Bridgette, having returned from surveying and turned back into her humanoid form, jokingly asks, "Do we need to shoot the moon to get back?"
Frenwick: One chime

Eldrune looks up at the moon and notices that it isn't all washed in red, but the bottom portion of it still looks the same bright white from before. The white portion of the moon emits a moonbeam down toward the sand.

Eldrune: "Do we have to go to the moonbeam to get back to the mansion?"
Frenwick: One chime

Ace: "Okay, we'll talk to you when we're back at the mansion." Ace then moves to begin picking up the [[Frenwick's Tears\|Frenwick's Tears]], but Frenwick lets out a lot of chimes close together, as if he's frantic.

Ace pauses picking up stones and asks, "Will we be able to communicate with you again using these stones?"
Frenwick: Two chimes

Ace: "Is there a way to communicate with you back at the mansion?"
Frenwick: One chime

Ace: "If we use higher level tears to talk to you, will we be able to communicate better?"
Frenwick: One chime

Ace: "Are there higher level tears back at the mansion?"
Frenwick: One chime

Ace: "Are they located in the lobby and/or the kitchen?"
Frenwick: One chime

Eldrune notices that the light from the moon is fading.

Ace: "Okay, we'll talk to you back at the mansion. But the moonlight is fading and we have to go."

Eldrune, to hurry the process along, kicks one of the tears. Ace hurries to pick them all up. The party then hikes toward the moonbeam. After about an hour, they reach the location where the moonbeam meets the sand. By the time they get there, it has been reduced to a thin sliver. 

The party steps into the light and gets teleported back to the lobby area. When they arrive, they notice that they don't feel the presence of Frenwick like they are accustomed to. Another noticeable change is that the lobby has a front door. Bridgette opens the door to find that it opens out into the meadow that the party arrived to the mansion from. Bridgette closes the door for now. The [[Magik Eyetems Booth\|Magik Eyetems Booth]] has no one attending it and appears to be closed for the first time since it appeared to the party.

Ace immediately upon arriving back to the mansion begins looking for more [[Frenwick's Tears\|Frenwick's Tears]].
