### **Summary of Events**
Eldrune and Fiorella are lounging in the lobby when Ash, Ace, and Dante arrive back in the lobby after the events of [[Episode 2\|Episode 2]]. Eldrune is flopped on a couch and using her dragon companion Damaia as a footstool. Ash immediately asks to give the dragon scritches.

After everyone introduces themselves, a new portal opens up in the lobby. On the other side is a large manmade garden full of flowers. As the party steps through the portal, it closes behind them. Ash picks a flower.

The garden has different paths snaking through it. As the party walks forward on the path they stepped out on, they see a mansion that seems to materialize out of the fog in front of us. There are gardens to the left and right that go around the mansion to the back. There are also about 5 little sheep in front of the mansion. Ash tries to befriend the sheep.

There are two doors on the mansion with knockers. Fiorella notices that the mansion that seems to be beautiful and well kept is in fact neither of those things. It looks more like a ruined mansion that is falling off of its foundations. As Fiorella points this out the rest of the party, the illusion dissipates and the area seems to transform before their eyes. The party looks around and finds that they aren't in a flower garden at all -- the grass is dead and the flowers are wilted. The "sheep" that Ash was petting are actually little fae creatures wrapped in darkness. However, they are still making sheep noises.

The flower that Ash picked earlier dissolves into mush. Ash attempts to wipe the flower goo off on the "sheep", but is unsuccessful. There are still a couple of flowers remaining, but they aren't particularly impressive.

The party decides to try to enter the spooky mansion. Eldrune and Ash stand on Damaia to grab the knockers and knock. They knock three times. The "sheep" turn to the party and let out a loud noise. Nothing happens besides that, so Eldrune tries to open the door and finds that it is locked. 

Ace asks Dante to try to kick the door open. The party backs up slightly to give him room. He succeeds, and the doors fly off their hinges into the darkness. As the doors get kicked in, the "sheep" charge toward the party with weapons in hand. None of them appear to have ranged weapons. The party prepares to fight them.

The party makes short work of the faelings, and Eldrune gets an upgraded hand crossbow off of the leader. Ace finds 2 round [[Frenwick's Tears\|Frenwick's Tears]] in the fake flowers, and Eldrune finds gold on the bodies of the faelings. Frenwick, for his part, sarcastically applauds, and promises the party a bonus if they make it out alive.

The party enters the mansion. About 2-3 steps inside, they notice 8 separate doorways. However, 3 are effectively destroyed. Of the remaining 5 doorways, 3 are on the first floor and two are on the second. There are sickly green strands emanating from each of the non-destroyed doorways that lead up to a wall at the top of a grand staircase.

The party heads to the first door on the right on the bottom floor. Dante (and only Dante) notices a smell reminiscent of his fondest memories as he approaches the door. Behind the door there is a pedestal that appears to have a green glowing energy ball to everyone but Dante. To Dante, the pedestal has an imitation of his most prized possession. The pedestal has an engraving on it that reads "To strive for greatness means to leave behind that which you treasure most." Ace and Ash see Dante soften slightly for the first time ever.

Dante picks up the object on the pedestal. As he starts to put it away, it begins to shake, and an otherworldly noise emanates from the item. As Dante holds the item to his ear to better hear the sound, he realizes it sounds like crying, as if someone is wailing in the distance. Suddenly, the item begins to morph, and quickly turns into a banshee.

The party manages to defeat the banshee fairly quickly. Upon doing so, Fiorella finds that she now has a ruby in her hand. The party also notices that the green strand linking Dante's door to the wall at the top of the staircase is gone, and the wall seems to flicker intermittently.

The doorway next to Dante's belongs to Ash. Similarly to Dante, as Ash approaches the room, he smells scents reminiscent of their fondest memory. His fondest memory is the moment that he first met Ace back in the Feywild. The interior of the room is basically identical to Dante's room, right down to the engraving on the pedestal. While the rest of the party sees a green ball of light on the pedestal in Ash's room, Ash sees the wooden token they used to identify themself to Ace to gain their trust. This token is his most prized possession. As he palms the real token in his pocket, he hesitates to part with it. However, the imitation on the pedestal begins to rumble. Ash caves, placing their token on the pedestal. As he does so, he loses all memory of the object. In the same pocket where the token used to be, he finds a one-pointed [[Frenwick's Tears\|Frenwick's Tear]]. 

Ace's room is the next one that the party finds. As Ace approaches the door, they smell petrichor and flowers. On their pedestal, they see a pressed daisy. A huge field of daisies is the first thing Ace and Ash saw when they finally crossed over to the Material Plane. Ace keeps a pressed daisy in the locket around their neck as a reminder of that moment. Ace takes the flower out of their locket, presses it to their forehead, then gently places it on the pedestal. The flower, and Ace's memories of it, are completely destroyed. In its place on the pedestal is a one-pointed [[Frenwick's Tears\|Frenwick's Tear]].

Eldrune's room is the next that the party finds. As Eldrune approaches the door, she smells the familiar scent of a her family's restaurant and her favorite foods. She also chooses to leave behind her token, which is a bent spoon she wears on a necklace. Eldrune turns around and leaves the room before seeing that her spoon was replaced with a two-pointed [[Frenwick's Tears\|Frenwick's Tear]]. Ace, ever the hoarder of shiny things, runs in and grabs it.

Last but not least, the party comes upon Fiorella's room. Fiorella smells something almost volcanic that is reminiscent of the fire and ash that is pervasive in her homeland of Hell. Her token is a small urn containing ash from her home realm. Fiorella decides that she cannot bear to part with it and see her last memories of her home realm destroyed. The projection of her object on the pedestal morphs into another banshee, which the party again quickly dispatches.
