# **Eldrune**

### **Quick Snapshot**
- Dwarf Ranger, Drakewarden
- Pronouns: she/her

### **Backstory**
Eldrune lived in the town, Northlake, with her family for many years. Her family owned a family kitchen where many of the other dwarves who lived in the town would come and eat after a long day in the mines in the surrounding mountains near the town. The Ashwood family was known by everyone in their town. One day, Eldrune decided cooking in the kitchen with her family was all she ever knew and wanted to take an adventure. She traveled along the mountains where she ran into a group of goblins. The goblins were known as the Shardtooth tribe. Eldrune did not know she was not allowed to go past a certain point in the mountains and broke the alliance her family had made with the Shardtooth tribe. Eldrune ran back home when she realized she messed up, but by the time she got back, the tribe had already gotten to her family and destroyed everything they had worked for. 

Eldrune knew her family would never forgive her, so she packed a bag and started to search for a way to pay her family back in some way. The only thing she had left of her family was her spoon necklace. Along the way, she found a small black dragon. The dragon was fond of Eldrune from when she met her. Eldrune took the dragon in as a companion and named her Damia. During her travels, Frenwick (she still does not truly know who Frenwick is) contacted her and said, "I have a way for you to earn your family’s trust back." With no hesitation, Eldrune walked through a glowing hole that popped up in the middle of the mountains. She wanted to do everything and anything to get her family, even if it meant dying.
