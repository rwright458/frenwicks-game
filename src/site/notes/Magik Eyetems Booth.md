After the events of [[Episode 1\|Episode 1]], the party is teleported back to the mansion's lobby and notices a booth like the one above that sells magical items, manned by a vaguely humanoid figure made of sparkling light. The booth offers any magical item the party can conceive of, for a steep price of course.

| Rarity    | Value      |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Common    | 100 GP     |
| Uncommon  | 400 GP     |
| Rare      | 4,000 GP   |
| Very Rare | 40,000 GP  |
| Legendary | 200,000 GP |
| Artifact  | Priceless  |

Magical items that the party no longer has use for can be sold back to the vendor of the Magik Eyetems booth for 50% of the value for which they were purchased. Additionally, non-magical items can be sold back to the booth for 1/3 of their normal value.

Notably, the Magik Eyetems vendor also sells the ability to attune to more than 3 items. The price of extra attunement slots are as follows:

| Extra Slot | Price      |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 4th slot   | 20,000 GP  |
| 5th slot   | 50,000 GP  |
| 6th slot   | 100,000 GP |
