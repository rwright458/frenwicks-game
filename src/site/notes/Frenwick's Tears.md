# **Frenwick's Tears**

Frenwick’s Tears are special gems that increase in spikes the more powerful the magic inside the gem. From a flat, round gem all the way up to a 10 pointed star, each one houses some value to Frenwick and he wants them back. 

### **Tear Attributes:**
*Round*
One individual gemstone will be worth 20g to whoever trades it in, with a 5% bonus per additional gem, up to 50% at 10 gems. After 10 gems, it is a flat 50% bonus until 20 gems are acquired, at which point there is a 150% bonus. At any point after 10 gems, Frenwick may start to offer magical items in exchange. 

*Single point, teardrop shaped*
A single gem is worth 50g with the same incremental gain as the Round gem. 

*Diamond (Rhombus)*
A single gem is worth 100g, same incremental gain. A bit more rare, this gem can be directly traded one-to-one for a spell scroll for a 2nd level spell or lower. This is a special spell scroll that can be cast by the holder regardless of spellcasting prowess. 

*Tri-Point Star*
Each is worth 200g, same incremental gain. With an Attack Action, these are usable as thrown weapons, each acting as an enhanced version of a Seeking Dart. This star will spin rapidly and chase an enemy down, never missing as long as the enemy isn’t completely surrounded by solid material thicker than wood. It deals 4d4+4 Force damage on hit. If the target is Undead, they are blinded for 2 turns. After use, this turns into a round tear. 

*4-Point Star*
Each worth 250g, same incremental gain. As an Action, this star can be “wished” to in order to replicate any 5th level or lower spell that anyone in the user’s party knows. It will be upcast to the highest spell slot level available to the party, up to 5th. If a saving throw is imposed, the Spell Save DC is set to either 16 or the combined level of the current party, whichever is higher. The max spell save DC for this is 30.
