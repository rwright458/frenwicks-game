## **Overview:**

The notorious trickster Frenwick was a menace. Wanted in all kingdoms for thievery and debauchery, he slowly began to grow bored of his own tricks. Despite being well respected by the God of Trickery, Frenwick challenged him to a simple game. The rules and nature of this game remain unknown, but Frenwick won. And with victory, came the powers of a god. 

There was silence from both Frenwick and the old god for some years before a mysterious Palace appeared in the middle of an open field. In a voice heard across the world, Frenwick spoke, “Come one, come all. Everything I’ve ever stolen in one place, now yours for the taking. You need only to survive my game.” 

Frenwick burned the location of his palace into every map that even had a portion of the plain visible. Over the next few months, some kingdoms tried sending whole armies, only to find there was a limit to how many could enter in a group. The rules were strange, but over time enough people survived to learn these rules, and understand how the dungeon works. But not all who lived came out unscathed, as the majority of surviviors seemed to be completely mad and spoke of little more than the "games" themselves. 

This is where you come in. Whether you're in it for yourself, you are part of a kingdom's army special forces, a prisoner forced in to earn your freedom, or an unfortunate soul who happened to come across the palace, you are now a part of the trickster god's game. Will you survive by yourself? Maybe make new friends with allies you didn't know you could make? Will you fall to the same greed that led many others to madness? Or will you be "different," the one who makes it through the challenges set in place and earn your fill. Walk away with riches, knowledge, a love... or even godhood?
