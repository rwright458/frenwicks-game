The party enters Frenwick's Mansion to participate in Frenwick's Game.

Frenwick's Game is an out of place mansion, with clouds above it spelling out "Frenwick's Game." When the party enters, the front door disappears behind them. Inside the mansion, the party steps into the lobby area for the game. It appears to be set up as a living room of sorts, with comfortable couches and furniture to rest on.

Eventually, the party hears a voice asking them to introduce themselves. Everyone can hear the voice, but no one is sure whether it's in their heads or audibly heard. After the party introduces themselves, Frenwick introduces himself as well and promises he can conceive of things for us to do.

The party sees a humanoid figure walking around that appears to be made of light, as if the light is refracting off of their figure. The voice feels like it is emanating from the figure. It gestures toward a blank wall and says we can enter when we are ready. Ace and Ash hold hands as the party steps through the wall portal.

After about 5 minutes of walking, the party hears a crumbling sound behind them. They turn and realize they are in a cave that is barely illuminated by sunlight. Ace can tell that it's dusk by the way the sun shifts and the red tinge of the light. There are sounds of screaming/groaning, but they don't sound nearby. The cae is narrow, about 20 feet wide or so. It extends forward at least 120 feet. It is dark enough that those without darkvision (Ace) have trouble seeing. Despite this, Ace notices a glimmer coming off of one of the rocks. They pick it up, which turns out to be a shiny round blue gem. (This is a round [[Frenwick's Tears\|Frenwick's Tear]]). As Ace puts the gem away, they notice that all their money is gone.

Dante pulls out his quarterstaff and starts walking forward. The screeches are getting louder/closer. Ash notices that there are two zombies at the edge of their darkvision. A battle begins.

After a difficult 1-minute battle against zombies, bats, and skeleton archers where Ace and Ash both go down, the remaining enemies crumble to dust. Frenwick appears and says he didn't expect us to be as bad as we were. After explaining that he had designed a "Minute To Kill" scenario, he revives Ace and Ash and gives everyone a long rest benefit out of pity.

The party continues walking through the cave, stepping onto something that sounds like dirt/mulch/gravel after about 10 minutes. They step into a somehow lit up courtyard inside the cave. The moon is visible, but so is the cave behind the moon. At the other end of the cave, there is a stone gate that is closed. On either side of the gate, there are two candelabras, each with five candles on it. There are two rows of 13 freshly dug grave sites.

Ash flies up to the first grave, and it has no casket inside. Instead, there is a giant tablet with a letter of the alphabet on it. Each grave has a different letter on a tablet inside of it. The gate has a riddle written in orcish on it. The riddle reads:

*I can fly like a bird not in the sky Which can always swim and always dry I say "Goodbye" at night and morning, "Hi" I'm part of you, what am I?*

Ace notices something leaning against the wall that refracts the light. They pick it up and notice it has more of the riddle on it. The rest of the riddle reads:

*I follow and lead as you pass Dress yourself in black, my darkness lasts I flee the light, but without the sun Your view of me would be gone*

The party agrees that the answer to the riddle is "shadow" and collects the letters for the answer. The letters slot into the indentations on the gate as if they had always been there. The gate proceeds to slide open like a pocket door. 

Beyond the gate, there is an empty void of darkness. About 20 feet in, there is a single lit bonfire. As the party passes the threshold, the crystal tablet disappears from Ace's inventory. Everyone receives 1000 gold. 

To stay together, Ash grabs Ace's hand. Ace plays Marco Polo with Dante, as Dante doesn't like holding hands. The party approaches the bonfire, and Ace and Ash sit at it while Dante stands behind them. After a few minutes, Frenwick's refraction appears on the opposite side of the bonfire. He congratulates us on solving the riddle, then encourages us to rest at the bonfire, saying that the party will meet his greatest foe, the one who killed his best friend.

Once Dante sits down, the party starts to notice color seeping into the room. There are bones everywhere, and not all of them humanoid (ex: there is a dragon skull). It appears to be a bone dump site. It extends over some walls, and beyond the walls it is pitch black. 

On the far end of a bridge, the party sees another bonfire. The bridge is made of bricks, but it is absolutely covered in bones. Beyond the fire, there is a sort of colored gate. Below the bridge, there is a 60-70 foot drop into an ocean of bones.

From the fire opposite the party, an ember emerges and approaches. It enters the party's fire and explodes, injuring the party. Almost all of the bridge is completely engulfed in light. The fire disappears and an armored skeleton riding a skeletal warhorse appears. It puts bones inside of the fire in its chest, and the fire burns brighter. The skeleton has a mace that also has fire inside of it. Combat begins.

After a short battle, the skeleton ends up on the ground off of its horse (where the party sees that the skeleton lacks bones below its knees). The skeleton takes the fire out of its chest and claps it between its hands, forcing the party to do a dexterity saving throw. Ash fails and goes down, but Dante and Ace succeed and stay standing. The skeleton crumbles to dust. 

Frenwick appears before the party, revives Ash to 1 hp, and expresses confusion as to how the group survived. Ash says that flying comes in handy, prompting Frenwick to temporarily delete Ash's wings. Ash uses all of their spell slots to continuously cast firebolt at Frenwick, though it seems to have no effect. Ace tells Ash to pick his battles. Dante offers Ash uppies, and Ash kicks Dante in the shin. Dante contemplates eating Ash.

Ace notices a shiny thing on the pommel of the skeleton's mace. Ace picks it up and reveals that it's a rhombus diamond shaped gem. (It's a 2 point [[Frenwick's Tears\|Frenwick's Tear]])

After the party gets teleported back to the lobby, they notice a sparkling light in a vaguely humanoid shape standing behind a booth with a sign that says "Magik Eyetems."
