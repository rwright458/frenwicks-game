**Quick Snapshot**
- Fairy Sorcerer, Aberrant Sorcery
- Pronouns: he/they
- Height: 3'7"

Ash is a fairy sorcerer who uses he/they pronouns, but feels pretty ambivalent about their gender as a concept. He is fairly short, at only 3'7" tall. They began as a spy for the Seelie court. On one of their missions within the Unseelie court, he was directed to seek out Ace for assistance in their mission. During this adventure, they became very close friends, eventually travelling to the Material Plane together to participate in Frenwick's Game.

Ash was motivated to play Frenwick's Game partially to escape his parents within the Seelie court, and partially because they were intent on following/protecting Ace. 

**Fun Facts**
- Has a little brother in the Seelie court
- Will do ANYTHING for someone he is close to
