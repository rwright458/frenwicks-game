### **Backstory**
Even as a child, Aro had a proclivity for violence. When he came of age, he decided to join the town guard, ostensibly to help protect his home. In truth, he took the position to learn to fight. After a short tenure, he was dishonorably discharged from the guard for using his newfound status to intimidate others and get his way. Aro, having had aspirations of becoming the next great military commander, did not take this well. He sought out Frenwick's Game for the promise of fame and power that it held. He even managed to convince Frenwick to take him on as a student of magic after performing well enough in the first few sessions of his game.
